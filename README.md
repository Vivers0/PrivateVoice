# Private Voice
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Vivers0/PrivateVoice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Vivers0/PrivateVoice)
## About
**private.js** - Creating private rooms in the category in which you specify (or in which the main voice channel is located)
**privateWithParent.js** - Automatic creation of private rooms and categories. If you turn off the bot, then it will stop working in the category in which it was before!

## Usage
In the file you selected, specify the token from the bot (**client.login("token here")**) and run it with one of the commands:
- **npm private** for private.js
- **npm privateParent** for privateWithParent.js

## P.S.
